# utils-greenkeeper

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/CExBBartolome/utils-greenkeeper.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A collection of personal utility libraries from a pinned version with tests accordingly.

## Rationale

I currently have several libraries I use often that is already outdated.

This repository is used as a canary test for upgrades with greenkeeper to check for breaking APIs.

## TODO

- Add tests for each of the packages
- Add travis.yml to run the tests
